## Publish

The `publish` command requires a local YML file. The default YML path used is `./hyperplay.yml`, but you can also specify the path to this file with the `--yml-path` flag or the `HYPERPLAY_YML_PATH` environment variable.

Note that in either case, you must pass a private key for an address added to your project or account with the cli flag `--private-key <value>`.

### YML
Create a `hyperplay.yml` in your project folder.

`zip` is true if you want to zip the folder or file prior to upload.
- Note that for HyperPlay submissions, you will need `zip: true` unless you are uploading a zip file.

Example YML config file:
```yml
account: test-ground
project: test44
release: 0.0.7

description: Release notes go here.

platforms:
  darwin_amd64: 
    path: dist/darwin/amd64/hello-go
    zip: true
    executable: go_app
  darwin_arm64: 
    path: dist/darwin/arm64/hello-go
    zip: true
    executable: go_app
  linux_amd64: 
    path: dist/linux/amd64/hello-go
    zip: true
    executable: go_app
# dist/windows/amd64/hello-go.zip zipped in a separate step so we don't need to zip with the cli
  windows_amd64: 
    path: dist/windows/amd64/hello-go.zip
    zip: false
    executable: go_app.exe
    installScript: install_deps.exe

```

Run the publish command from the hyperplay cli. Set the publisher private key via an envrionment variable if CI/CD.
```bash
HYPERPLAY_PRIVATE_KEY=0x1234 hyperplay publish
```

# FAQ

## How do I fix "user is not an account or project member"?

Make sure you pass the private key of your Release Manager with the flag `--private-key=<private_key>` 

For HyperPlay Projects, make sure the public key is added as a Release Manager on your HyperPlay project. You can modify the project members at https://developers.hyperplay.xyz/<account_name>/<project_name>/settings.

It is also possible to add the public key directly to your project through the [Valist registry](https://polygonscan.com/address/0xd504d012d78b81fa27288628f3fc89b0e2f56e24) by calling `addProjectMember`.

## How do I find my account or project name?

To get the account name, navigate to the [HyperPlay Dev Portal](https://developers.hyperplay.xyz) and on the project card, you can find your account name in the "Published by: <account_name" text.
